A few days ago, I added another year to my life.

Usually, I don’t really care about birthdays. They usually pass like any other day a few messages, a few calls, a quiet acknowledgment that time is moving. But this one felt different, I'm 25 years old now.

I’ve always seen life as a timeline. From 1 to 25, you just go through life. Most of the time, you’re unconscious. You follow paths that were drawn before you even understood you were walking. You do what you feel like you have to do. People like to say that it stops at 20, but for me, it didn’t. From 20 to maybe 22, I was still vibing. Moving with the current. Experiencing life without fully confronting it.

The second phase of life, from 25 to 50, is different. You can’t live the same way anymore. When you enter that period, responsibilities start to grow. Everything you do has an impact—not only on you, but also on the people around you.

Then comes the period from 50 to 75 if you’re still alive. That’s when some people look back. They think about their lives and wish they had done certain things during the 25 to 50 phase or they enjoy what they have took time to build and i don't necesseraly talk about money but relationship, family, love.

I’m writing this article at 25 to reflect on what I did from 1 to 25, and to think about what I plan or hope to do in this second phase of my life. For these reflections, I will try to follow the same pattern that I follow while writing my year-end review reflections by analyzing different areas of my life: academia and work, friendship, love, and family.

### Academia and work


--- 
### Friendship

---

### Love 

Oooh love, a strang feeling, i have been in love, broke people hearts, got my heart broken, in love again etc. I think if there is one areas of life in which i'm mostly resilient is Love. 

---
### Relationship

### And next ?

For this new phase I’m about to enter, I want to make **one promise to myself**—one promise that captures everything I hope to achieve. **Marius, you must be intentional in everything you do.** Being intentional means acting with purpose, with full awareness and choice, rather than just reacting automatically or drifting through life.  

There’s a quote in my Instagram bio that resonates with me:  
*"An ordinary person who works hard to design his life"* — **Jim Rohn**.  

I truly believe we can design the life we want, and that’s exactly what I aim to do in this phase:

- **Work as hard as I can.** Let’s not kid ourselves money is important, and I don’t want to worry about it in the later stages of my life.  
- **Build relationships that last a lifetime,** always being there for my friends and family.  
- **Build a family.** If my kids don’t hate me, I’ll consider that a win.  
- **Not focused on building a company or an empire** like many people but who knows, maybe that will change someday.
