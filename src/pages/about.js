                Hi i'm Marius a Congolese software engineer and writer living in
                Dakar Senegal. <br /> I wanted this place to feel like a human
                being website not only as a engineer one, that why you can find
                my playlists and reads since i'm a music and books lover.
                <br /> I sometimes write about what I've learned in my
                day-to-day work, experiences, or something that interests me to
                improve my knowledge base. <br />
              </p>

                Daily I build products for my own needs or my employer and I
                like and enjoy it. I can work on the entire stack from the
                database design, to the frontend, backend and take end-to-end
                ownership across all areas of the software development
                lifecycle, including: designing, building, releasing, and
                monitoring.
                <br />
                <br />
                To do all those things I use:
                <ul>
                  <li>Languages: Javascript (Typescript), Java, Go</li>
                  <li> DBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL </li>
                  <li> Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes </li>
                  <li> Messaging: Redis Pub/Sub</li>
                  <li> Cloud provider: AWS</li>
                  <li>
                    Monitoring: Grafana stack (Loki, Tempo, Grafana, Promtail),
                    OpenTelemetry, Prometheus
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>
                Outside of building and writing, I enjoy: <br />
                <ul>
                  <li> Reading books technical or not</li>
                  <li> Playing guitar, chess, and piano</li>
                  <li> Watching manga, basketball, and Formula 1</li>
                  <li> Spending quality time with people I love</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>
                <br />
                If you have a question or just want to say hi, feel free to
                reach out over email or find me on any social media.
