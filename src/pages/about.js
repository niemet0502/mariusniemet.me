                Hi, my name is Marius, i'm a software engineer and writer from
                Congo currently living in Dakar Senegal. <br /> Welcome in my
                little corner on the internet. <br /> <br /> I wanted this place
                to feel like a human being website not only as a engineer one,
                that why you can find the playlists that i created since i
                really love music and you can also find here the things i have
                recently read.
              </p>

                className="profile-picture"
                alt="profile"
              />

              <p>
                I sometimes write about what I've learned in my day-to-day work,
                experiences, or something that interests me to improve my
                knowledge base.
                <br />
                <br />
                On a daily basis I build products for my own needs or for my
                employer and i like and enjoy it, I can work on the entire stack
                from the database design, to the frontend and backend. I take
                end-to-end ownership across all areas of the software
                development lifecycle, including: designing, building,
                releasing, and monitoring.
                <br />
                <br />
                To do all those things I use:
                <ul>
                  <li>Languages: Javascript (Typescript), Java</li>
                  <li>Framework: React, Nestjs, ExpressJs, Spring-boot</li>
                  <li> DBMS: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB </li>
                  <li> Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes </li>
                  <li> Caching: Redis</li>
                  <li> Messaging: Kafka</li>
                  <li>Monitoring:</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>
                Outside of building and writing, I enjoy: <br />
                <ul>
                  <li> Reading books technical or not</li>
                  <li> Playing guitar, chess, and piano</li>
                  <li> Watching manga, basketball, and Formula 1</li>
                  <li> Spending quality time with people I love</li>
                </ul>
              </p>

              <p>
                <br />
